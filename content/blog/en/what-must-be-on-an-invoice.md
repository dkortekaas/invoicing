## What must be on an invoice?

As a freelancer in the Netherlands, your invoices must meet certain legal requirements set by the Dutch Tax Authority (Belastingdienst). Missing details can lead to issues with VAT deductions for your customers and potential fines.

### The 10 required invoice details

1. **Your company name and address**
2. **Your KvK (Chamber of Commerce) number**
3. **Your VAT number** (BTW-nummer)
4. **Customer's name and address**
5. **Unique invoice number** (sequential)
6. **Invoice date**
7. **Description of services or products**
8. **Amount excluding VAT**
9. **VAT rate and amount**
10. **Total amount including VAT**

### Additional recommended details

- **IBAN account number**
- **Payment terms** (e.g., 14 or 30 days)
- **iDEAL payment link** for faster payment

### Common mistakes to avoid

- Skipping the KvK number
- Non-sequential invoice numbering
- Missing VAT breakdown
- No clear payment terms
