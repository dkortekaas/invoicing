## Get paid faster with iDEAL payment links

One of the biggest challenges for freelancers is getting paid on time. Adding an iDEAL or Wero payment link to your invoices makes it easy for customers to pay immediately.

### Why use payment links?

- **11 days faster payment** on average
- **One-click payment** for your customers
- **Automatic payment confirmation**
- **Lower barrier** compared to manual bank transfers

### How does iDEAL work on invoices?

iDEAL is the most popular online payment method in the Netherlands. When you add an iDEAL link to your invoice, your customer can:

1. Click the payment link
2. Select their bank
3. Confirm the payment
4. Done — you receive the money immediately

### Setting up with Mollie

Mollie is the most popular payment provider for Dutch businesses. Integration is straightforward:
