## How do you create an invoice as a freelancer?

Creating a correct invoice is essential for every freelancer in the Netherlands. A good invoice ensures you get paid on time and keeps your administration in order for VAT returns.

In this guide, we walk you through step by step what should be on your invoice and how to create one easily.

### Step 1: Gather your business details

Every invoice must include your own business details:

- **Company name** (as registered with KvK)
- **Address**
- **KvK number**
- **VAT number** (format: NL123456789B01)
- **IBAN account number**

### Step 2: Fill in the customer details

Also include your customer's details:

- Company name or full name
- Address
- VAT number (required for B2B within the EU)

### Step 3: Invoice number and date

Use a **sequential numbering system**. For example:
- 2026-001, 2026-002, 2026-003
- Or: INV-2026-0001

Also include:
- **Invoice date**
- **Payment terms** (e.g., 14 or 30 days)

### Step 4: Describe your services

Be specific about what you delivered:

| Description | Quantity | Rate | Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web development January 2026 | 40 hours | EUR 85.00 | EUR 3,400.00 |

### Step 5: Calculate VAT

The Netherlands has three VAT rates:
- **21%** - standard rate (most services)
- **9%** - reduced rate (food, books, medicines)
- **0%** - exempt (education, healthcare, export)

### Step 6: Send the invoice

Send your invoice as a **PDF by email**. Even better: add an **iDEAL payment link** so your customer can pay immediately.
